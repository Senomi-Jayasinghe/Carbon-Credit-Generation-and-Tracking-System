# Carbon-Credit-Generation-and-Tracking-System

Designed and developed a web-based platform for generating and trading carbon credits from home gardens in Sri Lanka, encouraging sustainable practices and helping mitigate climate change. The system tracks tree growth and calculates carbon credits based on CO2 sequestration using complex mathematical models. It includes an image recognition module to track tree growth, a carbon credit marketplace for trading credits, and a wallet system for storing sales proceeds. This system helps home garden owners generate income by selling carbon credits to businesses.

Key Features:
• Carbon credit calculation based on tree growth and CO2 sequestration.
• Image recognition technology to measure tree height and growth.
• Integrated marketplace for buying and selling carbon credits.
• Match-making algorithm to match buy orders and sell orders in the marketplace. 
• Dashboard for home garden owners to manage trees, track carbon credits, and view sales 
 history.
• Order Blotter Dashboard to show Market Watch.
• Secure registration for carbon credit buyers, sellers, and authorizers.
